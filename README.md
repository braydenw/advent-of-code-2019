## [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)
Work from Advent of Code 2019.  
Each day is in its own folder within this workspace.  
Any code shared between days is broken out into its own library.

To run work from a given day: `cargo run -p day## <1|2>`.  
If a part is not specified with `1|2`, then both will be run.
