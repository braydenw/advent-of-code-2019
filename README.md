## [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)  
Each day is in its own folder within this workspace.  
Most code shared between days is broken out into the `common` library.

To run work from a given day: `cargo run [--release] -p <day##> [1|2]`.  
If a part is not specified with `1|2`, then both will be run.
